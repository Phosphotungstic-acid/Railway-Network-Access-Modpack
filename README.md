# 简介
## 内容概述
Railway Network Access 是一个专注于提升地铁、轻轨、铁路等轨道交通以及公路和城市建筑的创造模式建造体验的整合包，可通过其建造一个现代化城市和各式各样的轨道交通。

Railway Network Access 以流行铁路模组作为轨道交通和铁路建设的基础，并在此之上添加了更多建材扩展类模组以丰富建材选择。部分建筑辅助模组和信息显示模组同样被包含入内，以用于提升建造的便利程度。在优化方面，通过添加模组实现了对游戏加载、进出世界及区块加载等方面速度的提升；使用画面渲染优化、方块剔除及光照优化模组提升了游戏的综合帧率；借助内存优化模组降低了游戏的内存占用并降低了内存或显存泄露等事件的概率。同时，一些功能简单却有效的杂效模组亦被添加，解决了许多虽不严重却十分影响心情的问题。

## 特色简述
1. 仿真的轨道交通系统：以热门铁路模组为基础、真实性强、高自由度；
2. 丰富的建筑材料选择：添加了大量的原版方块变体、现代化灯具、城建装饰方块和道路装饰方块；
3. 较好的性能优化：使用各类优化模组对画面渲染、内存占用、区块加载、多人游戏网络、逻辑处理和游戏加载等方面的性能提升；
4. 多人游戏体验：采取相应模组对多人游戏设置和网络连接进行优化；
5. 特殊挑选的模组：专门挑选符合包主题的模组，并确保包中的每个模组都对玩家有用且有益，避免添加像JEI物品管理器或农夫乐事这样对轨道交通和城市建设几乎完全无用的模组，力求让这个包区别于普通的冒险包或建造/技术包，同时精心配置某些模组，确保它们无缝集成；
6. 专为城市与轨交建筑师制作：为提升建筑体验，禁用了所有粒子和部分屏幕效果，移除了大部分生物的自然生成（所有在主世界生成的生物、所有敌对生物）。这些改动可以关闭。

# Introduction
## Content Overvie
Railway Network Access is a modpack dedicated to enhancing the creative-mode building experience for rail transit systems—such as subways, light rail, and railways—as well as roads and urban architecture, enabling the construction of modern cities and diverse rail transit networks.

Railway Network Access Modpack includes popular railway mods as the foundation for rail transit and railway construction. Building upon this core, it incorporates numerous material expansion mods to diversify construction material options. Several building-assistance and information-display mods are also included to improve construction convenience. In terms of optimization, the modpack integrates modules that accelerate game loading, world entry/exit, and chunk loading. Visual rendering optimization, block culling, and lighting enhancement mods collectively improve overall framerates. Memory optimization mods are employed to reduce the game's memory footprint and lower the probability of memory or VRAM leaks. Additionally, a selection of simple yet effective utility mods has been added to address various minor but persistently annoying issues.

## Feature Summary
1. Simulated Rail Transit System: Built upon popular railway mods, it offers a highly authentic and free-form experience.
2. Extensive Construction Material Selection: Adds a wide variety of vanilla block variants, modern lighting fixtures, urban decorative blocks, and road detailing elements.
3. Substantial Performance Optimization: Employs a range of optimization mods to improve performance in areas including visual rendering, memory usage, chunk loading, multiplayer networking, logic processing, and game loading times.
4. Enhanced Multiplayer Experience: Incorporates specific mods to optimize multiplayer settings and network connectivity.
5. Curated Mod Selection: Carefully selects mods that align with the pack's theme, ensuring each included mod is useful and beneficial to the player. Mods that are largely irrelevant to rail transit and city building—such as JEI (Just Enough Items) or Farmer's Delight—are intentionally excluded. This approach distinguishes the pack from generic adventure or building/tech packs. Furthermore, specific mods are meticulously configured to ensure seamless integration.
6. Designed for City & Transit Architects: To optimize the building experience, all particle effects and certain screen effects are disabled by default, and the natural spawning of most mobs (including all overworld-spawning creatures and all hostile mobs) is removed. These changes are configurable and can be re-enabled.
